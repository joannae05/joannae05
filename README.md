## 💡 About Me  
I’m a Colombian-American, FGLI student passionate about **expanding access to education and tech**.  
On campus, I serve as:  
- 🎯 **External Coordinator** @ [Emerging Coders](#) (supporting FGLI & underrepresented CS students)  
- 📚 **Director of Education** @ [FutureDev](#) (helping peers gain real-world CS skills through mentorship & projects)  

I love building projects that have **real community impact**, collaborating with peers, and always learning something new. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me 🎶 dancing, 🛼 roller skating, or 🎬 watching anime.
